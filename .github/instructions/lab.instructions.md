# Lab Projects

To get started with assisting with and developing lab projects, please follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the specific lab folder under the labs directory based on the user's request of which lab to work on.
2. Refer the .md file in the resepctive lab folder for detailed information, instructions, and requirements for the lab project.
3. There may also be pre-existing code files in the lab folders that are sample files provided by the course instructor as a foundation for the lab project. It is critical that you use these files and build upon them.
4. Guide the user step by step in completeing a lab. Focus on completing each part in a lab before proceeding to the next.
5. If there are any documents being referred to in the instructions that you need knowledge of, as the user to provide them to you before proceeding so you don't work on assumptions. 
6. If there are references to other lab projects, you can simply refer them in the same codebased in the labs folder. The material_text folder contains lecture slides which may also be useful in completing the labs.
