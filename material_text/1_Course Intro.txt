Important Things to Mention
•This course is ASIC based. No FPGA experience is required.
•All parts of the course (assignments, lectures, etc.) can be done 
online. We will meet a few times in person.
•This is my first time offering this course. I am open to feedback. Please do not hesitate to let me know what you think.
•I’ve almost combined two courses into one. So, this is a heavy course. You’ll stay busy, but you’ll learn a lot.
•On Discord, I will have notifications set to “@ mentions only” . Hopefully your questions will be resolved by the TA/IA and other 
students. If not, @ me.

Kickoff Quiz/Survey will be released later 
today

Aside: What is an ECO (Engineering Change Order) ?
Spec Freeze
Logic FreezeTapeout
•Base Layer
•Metal Layer
If an RTL bug is identified after Logic Freeze, it is 
“surgically” implemented in the netlist. Avoid re-
synthesis. This is called an ECO. Approvals required.

Terminology

Architecture, Microarchitecture, Design
•Architecture: The abstract specification of system behavior (e.g., 
instruction set, communication protocol, or functional model).
•Defines “what” operation a system performs
•Microarchitecture: The concrete implementation of that 
behavior using registers, memories, gates, control paths, and 
data paths.
•Organization and structure of a digital system’s blocks
•Defines “how” the system performs operations
•Less abstract than architecture
•Design: Implementing a microarchitecture
•Microarchitecture guides design. Serves as a “plan” for design.
•Slightly less abstract and more detailed than microarchitecture
17Level of 
abstraction

Verification vs. Testing
Verification
•Target design bugs
•Goal: Check that design 
correctly implements the 
specification
•Performed when the chip is 
being designed
•Performed once prior to manufacturing
•Responsible for quality of design
•Can observe and control all nodes in the designTesting
•Target manufacturing defects
•Goal: Check that manufactured part correctly 
implements design
•Performed after the chip is 
manufactured
•Test application done for every chip
•Responsible for quality of shipped parts
•Can only control and observe primary inputs and outputs

Validation
•Performed on ‘alive’ silicon
•ie. after the device has passed ‘manufacturing test’
•Develop validation boards (EVB)
•Simple functionality checks
•Boot the OS and run “actual” tests or benchmarks
•Perform power and electrical measurements
19

Emulation
•Using specialized hardware to realize your design before the ‘actual Silicon’
•Either FPGA based (like Veloce  from Siemens (Mentor Graphics))
•Or processor based (like Palladium  from Cadence)
•Simulation acceleration
•Simulation is slow
•Prepares you for Validation
•Can run software/drivers/ etc before Silicon arrives
•When Silicon arrives, re- use design/test collateral 
•Thereby, aiding Silicon bring- up
•Emulation has limitations
•Analog blocks
•Real clocking/reset logic
•Real timing verification
•Difficult to debug!!! [Simulation is slow. But you can see everything!]
