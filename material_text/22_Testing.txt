•Causes a logical failure in the 
design (opens/shorts)
•Stuck- at faults
•Speed defects
•Affects the timing/performance of the design (weak transistors/resistive vias)
•Transition faults
•Path delay faults
•Leakage defects
•Cause high (unexpected) Iddq current in static conditions

How to Screen Manufacturing Defects
•Test each device ( different from verification )
•Apply a stimulus
•Measure the response
•Compare expected and measured response
•The stimulus should be chosen such that good and bad device responses 
are different
A defect is detected by observing an error caused by it
8

Fault Models
•Manufacturing defects are a physical phenomena
•Surface impurities, dielectric breakdown…
•Need to be correlated to circuit behavior
•Fault models – a view/abstraction of the defects
•Logic
• Stuck- at faults
• Transition faults
• Path -delay faults
• Bridging faults
• IDDQ faults
•Memory
• Stuck- at faults
• Transition faults
• Coupling faults
• Neighborhood pattern sensitive faults
9

Goals of Testing
•Determine that the manufactured chip matches the designed chip
•Cover high percentage of modeled faults
•Minimize test time (and hence device cost)
•Support debug and fault diagnosis
10

Coverage Analysis
11
Typically reported metricPercentage of faults detected among the total faults. 

Fault Coverage and Grading
•Fault coverage
•Percentage of faults detected among the total faults tested. 
•Want higher fault coverage to higher quality testing
•Fault grading
•How many faults does a pattern  detect?
•The higher the fault grade of a pattern set, the greater the probability of 
obtaining fault -free circuits.
12

Can Use Functional Tests (aka Verification Stimulus)
•Not suitable for exhaustive testing of all manufacturing defects
• Cost of such tests will make any chip unsellable
•4-bit counter takes 24 patterns to verify complete functionality but 
only 8 patterns for structural testingVector

Testing vs. Verification
•Verification checks compliance of implementation vis -a-vis the 
specification
•Testing (aka Manufacturing Test) check compliance of silicon vis-
a-vis design implementation

Combinational Circuit
All internal nodes of interest can be controlled 
to logic 0 or 1, and any change in the desired logic value at a node of interest, due to a fault, 
can be observed externallyA “testable” circuit

What is DFT?
•Design For Test
•Design features to enable controllability and observability for exhaustive 
testing – Scan, BIST
•Enable direct testing of critical IPs – Analog expose, etc
•Debug/corrective features – Scan debug, Memory repair/diagnostics, etc
•Test time optimization – Scan compression
•Chip mode configuration and on-board testing – JTAG

• Source -drain of transistor shorted leading 
to increased current flow at quiscient  state 
(not switching)


Detecting stuck -at faults
•To detect stuck -at fault
•Need to use test pattern that causes output to be 
different if fault present

Scan and ATPG
28

To test logic, I need to apply “patterns” or values to the internal nodes.
How can I do that? Is there a way I can access the nodes from PIs/POs?
Idea: Stitch all FFs in a long shift register. Now use this to set values to internal nodes.
This chain is called a Scan Chain

Scan
•Most widely used DFT technique in industry
•Every flip -flop in the design is converted to a scannable flop
•Once the FFs are converted, they are stitched together to form one or more 
shift registers referred to as scan chain(s)
•Types of Scan methodologies
•Clocked Scan FF
•LSSD
•Multiplexed FF
•Multiplexed flip -flop scan is the mostly used style.

 Internal Scan ChainsPRPG
MISRPseudo Random Pattern Generator
Multiple Input Signature RegisterCan’t store all required test patterns on chip. 
So, use a PRPG. Reduces test length but sacrifices fault coverage.
Combines and compresses input data into a signature.Can simply perform a checksum operation.

Linear Feedback Shift Register
•A shift register whose serial input bit is a linear function of the 
current register bits
•Call “linear” because uses mod-2 addition (XORs)
•Proper choice of feedback connections ( taps)
•Gives 2n-1 different patterns (misses all 0’s)
•1000, 1100, 1110, 1111, 0111, 1011, 0101, 1010, 1101, 0110, 0011, 
1001, 0100, 0010, 0001, 1000, …

Modified LFSR
•Modified LFSR
•Generates all -0 pattern
•Add an AND gate
•When state is 0001, next state is 0000
•When state is 0000, next state is 1000
•Otherwise, the sequence is the same as before


Multiple Input Signature Register
•MISR
•Compacts input stream into n-bit signature
•2n possible signatures
•Only 1 is correct and others indicate an error has occurred
•“Aliasing”
•Faulty signature maps to fault -free signature
•Probability on order of 1/2n


Memory Testing
56

Testing Memories
•Embedded memories are the densest components within a 
system -on-chip (SOC)
•Memories are most sensitive to process defects
•Memories account for large part of SOC area

Memory Faults
•Stuck -At Fault
–Control signal or 
Memory cell stuck -at 
particular value
•Stuck -at 0 
•Stuck -at 1


Memory Faults
•Transition Faults
–Control signals or memory cells cannot make transition from
•1 to 0 (Down transition Fault)
•0 to 1 (Up Transition fault) 


Memory Faults 
•Coupling Faults
•One cell’s transition impacts the value in another cell

Memory Faults
•Neighborhood Pattern Sensitive Faults
–Write operation on a group of surrounding cells 
effects the value of one or more neighboring cells.

Memory Testing Techniques
•Direct access to embedded memories from an external Automatic 
Test Equipment
•Patterns are applied from an external ATE
•Advantages
•Straightforward to change the test algorithms
•Disadvantages
•Increasing memory sizes require larger test set, this increases tester cost
•For proper testing of memories at high speed memory test must operate at high speed as 
well. This requires very expensive ATE
•Due to pin constraints, it is difficult to provide direct access for every embedded memory

Memory Testing Techniques
•Embedded CPU
•Advantages
•No hardware modifications are required (assuming a CPU is available on the chip 
already)
•Test algorithms can be modified
•Disadvantages
•Might not always have access to all memories
•Hard to test memories that store memory test programs

Memory Testing Techniques
•Built In Self Test (BIST)
•Advantages
•BIST can run at system speed which improves fault detection capability. Don’t need 
a costly ATE.
•A chip spends much less amount of time on the ATE (compared to if the ATE was 
sending in all patterns)
•BIST can provide diagnostic resolution down to one memory cell
•Allows testing multiple memory blocks in parallel → reduced test time
•Disadvantage
•Hardware overhead
•However with increase memory sizes the overhead is relatively small
•Performance penalty

BIST Area overhead


Memory Testing Algorithms
•Address Decoder Algorithm
•Used to check stuck-at faults in address decoder
•Write to a neighboring address with hamming distance of one and check if 
this also writes to the base cell
•Steps
•Step 1: Write 000..0 at address location 1010 (base address)
•Step 2: Write 111..1 at address location 1000 (testing address)
•Step 3: Read the data at base address and testing address
•Step 4: If base address shows a value of 1 then error on address[1]

Memory Testing Algorithms
•March Algorithm
–Run with varying data backgrounds


Memory Testing Algorithms
•March Algorithm
•Variations
•March X, March C, March C -
•Test Length
•7N, 11N, 13N (N=no of memory locations)
•Fault Coverage
•Stuck at Faults (SAFs), Transition Faults (TFs), Address Decoder Faults (AFs), 
Inversion Coupling Faults ( CFins ), Static/State Coupling Faults ( CFsts ) and 
Idempotent coupling Faults (CFid ).

Memory Testing Algorithms
•Checkerboard Algorithm
–Cells are divided into two groups cell -a and cell -b, 
forming  a checkerboard pattern such that every 
neighboring cell is in different group
•Step 1:Write 1 in all cell -a and 0 in cell -b
•Step 2:Read all cells
•Step 3:Write 0 in all cell -a and 1 in cell -b
•Step 4:Read all cells

Memory Testing Algorithms
•Checkerboard Algorithm 
•Detects shorts between adjacent cells
•Not all address decoder faults are detected
•Stuck -at faults can be detected as long as address decoder is correct
•Not all coupling faults are detected
•Worst case test for leakage between adjacent cells
–Each cell containing a one is surrounded by zeros
•Test Length =                 (N=Total Address Bits)

Testing Analog Blocks
•Multiple methods
•Analog BIST
•Add BIST logic that applies inputs and compares outputs
•Generating analog inputs takes a lot of hardware
•Storing expected analog outputs also is impractical
•Very simple testing can usually be done using BIST
•Expose analog block inputs and outputs to the PIs and POs of the chip
•More common method
•Use ATE to apply inputs and compare outputs
•Analog Blocks during Scan
•Add additional “wrappers” to avoid X poisoning
