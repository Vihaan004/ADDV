## Part #1: Pipelined Processor

Verilog code and testbench for a non-pipelined MIPS processor are provided at  `/usr/local2/COURSES/ADDV/LAB2` on the Apporto server. Contents of this directory are shown below: 

```markdown
Lab2/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ testbench.v               # Testbench
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ top.v                     # Top level design instance
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ controller.v              # Controller 
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ datapath.v                # Data path
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ top_with_sram.v           # Alternative top level design, uses memory cells for imem and dmem
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ compile_with_sram.tcl     # Synthesis script to map memories to memory cells
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sram_32x64/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SRAM_32x64_1rw.db     # SRAM library for synthesis
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SRAM_32x64_1rw.v      # Behavioral verilog model for simulation
```

The code provided in the above directory is taken from the book chapter mentioned above, and the testbench is based on the MIPS processor lecture in CSE 320.

This design supports the following instructions: `add`, `sub`, `and`, `or`, `slt`, `lw`, `sw`, `beq`.

### Your tasks:

1. **Convert to 5-Stage Pipeline:**
    
    Modify the given non-pipelined MIPS processor design into a 5-stage pipelined processor.
    
2. **Use SystemVerilog Syntax:**
    1. Given code uses Verilog, you need to update it to use SystemVerilog syntax. For example, use `always_ff` instead of `always`, and `logic` instead of `reg` or `wire`.
    2. Try using as much System Verilog syntax as possible. There are no specific requirements like interfaces or enums. Points will only be deducted if no SystemVerilog syntax is observed.
3. **Hazard Handling:**
    1. You are **not required** to implement any special methods like forwarding or flushing for hazard management.
    2. Instead, **stall the pipeline** whenever any hazard is detected.
4. **Simulation and Verification:**
    1. Simulate and verify your pipelined processor design using the provided testbench.
    2. You should test all the instructions supported: `add`, `sub`, `and`, `or`, `slt`, `lw`, `sw`, `beq`. For this, add machine code to `memfile.dat` to populate instruction memory and update `expected_data`, `expected_addr` arrays in the testbench. You can refer to the CSE 320 slides for the Processor Design lecture (it‚Äôll save some work for you).
5. **Synthesis:**
    1. Synthesize both the original non-pipelined design and your new pipelined design.
6. Synthesis with SRAM library:
    1. The synthesis you just did mapped both imem and dmem to flip-flops. That‚Äôs because we only provided a standard cell library to the synthesis tool that has only logic gates and flip-flops. But this is inefficient for large memories. Let‚Äôs do a short experiment to map the imem and dmem blocks to memory arrays (SRAMs).
    2. Modify your design to use the SRAM model given in `/usr/local2/COURSES/ADDV/LAB2/sram_32x64/` and synthesize using `compile_with_sram.tcl`  script provided.
    3. While doing this, you will need to replace top.sv with top_with_sram.sv
    4. Note that behavioral Verilog model of SRAM should be used only for simulation, not for synthesis. We are not asking you to do simulate in this part of the lab though, so the Verilog model is not going to be used.

> You are not allowed to change the top-level interface (only change internals). Strictly follow the design hierarcy shown below:
> 

```markdown
- testbench
 - top
 	 - mips
		 - controller
		 - datapath
	 - imem
	 - dmem
```

> The datapath file should be structured in the following order:
> 

```markdown
- Fetch logic
- Fetch-to-decode pipeline registers
- Decode/RF logic (Including an instance of register file and other logic)
- Decode-to-execute pipeline registers
- Execute logic (Including an instance of ALU and other logic)
- Execute-to-memory pipeline registers
- Memory logic (if any)
- Memory-to-writeback pipeline registers
- Writeback logic
```

## Part #2: Customizations to the processor

This section includes adding a custom instruction and a performance monitoring unit to your pipelined MIPS processor.

### Tasks:

1. Add `MULADD` instruction:
    - Add support for a new custom instruction called MULADD that performs c = a*b+c. Assume that multiplying two 32-bit numbers results in a 32-bit answer (instead of 64-bit).
    - Note that this instruction needs 3 operands. Think of how you can obtain 3 operands.
    - An example of this instruction is `MULADD $1, $2, $3` which will perform this operation:
        - $1 (new value) ‚Üê $2 * $3 + $1 (current value)
    - Add a `MULADD` instruction to the program and verify this instruction.
2. Add Performance Monitor Capability
    - Performance monitors (also called perfmon) are blocks added into the design to monitor the performance of a processor. Generally, these blocks count different types of important events happening in a processor, such as the number of cache misses, and their values can be read by a programmer using special instructions.
    - Create a new `performance_monitor` module with two counters:
        - Cycle counter - Counts the number of cycles elapsed since the last reset
        - Instruction counter - Counts the number of instructions finished since the last reset
    - Add a new `perfmon` instruction with the following format: `perfmon <register>, <flag>`
        - When this instruction is executed, one of the two counters (specified in the instruction using the flag: 0=cycle counter, 1=instruction counter) is read into a register (specified in the instruction)
    - An example of this instruction is `perfmon $1, 0` which will return the cycle counter in the register $1
    - Add a `perfmon` instruction to the program and verify this instruction.

## Extra Credit:

1. **Data Hazards:** Forwarding logic for the `ADD` instruction ONLY
    - Implement data forwarding logic in your pipelined processor that only applies to the `ADD` instruction.
    - Add a specific test case (a new instruction file) with a sequence of instructions involving data hazards with `ADD` instructions. Verify that your forwarding logic works correctly.
2. **Control hazards:** Flushing logic for the `BEQ` instruction ONLY
    - Implement pipeline flushing logic to handle control hazards caused by the `BEQ` (Branch if Equal) instruction only.
    - Add a specific test case (a new instruction file) with a sequence of instructions that cause control hazards with `BEQ` instructions. Verify that your flushing logic works correctly.
