oInfiniband  is a network interface for high -
speed communication between the host 
and the Palladium system. It is necessary 
for IXCOM designs.
oInfiniband  also improves the performance 
of runtime commands in ICE designs.IXCOM Acceleration

oSystem -level debugging ‒ with embedded 
software.
oStress test of the final design with real -
world targets. 
oSoftware development and testing prior to 
silicon tapeout.
oProvides pre - (and post -) silicon debug 
platforms.
oCustomers can create c ustom boards to 
interact with their design running on the 
Palladium system. 
oCadence also provides speed bridges that can 
interface with Protium
